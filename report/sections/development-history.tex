\section{Sprint 1: Basic expressions}\label{sec:sprint-1:-basic-expressions}

This sprint focused on implementing a lexer and parser for the language, with precedence rules for the arithmetic 
operators, parsed with Pratt parsing.

\subsection{Grammar in BNF}\label{subsec:grammar-in-bnf1}

\begin{verbatim}
<expr> ::= <term> | <term> '+' <expr> | <term> "-" <expr>
<term> ::= <factor> | <factor> "*" <term> | <factor> "/" <term>
<factor> ::= <number> | "(" <expr> ")"
<number> ::= <int> | <float>
<int> ::= <digit> | <digit> <int>
<float> ::= <int> "." <int>
<digit> ::= "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | "7" | "8" | "9"
\end{verbatim}

\section{Sprint 2: Variable assignment}\label{sec:variable-assignment}

In this sprint we added variable assignment to the parser, with the ability to bind an expression to a variable 
name, as well as a few new operators such as \textit{==} for equality and \textit{\%} for modulo, as well as 
unary operators.

\end{verbatim}

\section{Sprint 3: Interpreter}\label{sec:interpreter}

In this sprint a basic interpreter was implemented, with the ability to evaluate expressions and variable bindings.
We used a simple environment to store variable bindings (a map of \textit{string} name to \textit{expr}), and a 
recursive evaluation function to evaluate expressions.
It was a REPL style interpreter, where the last expression of a statement list was evaluated and printed, and ran through
the command line.
We did not change the grammar in this sprint.

\section{Sprint 4: Functions}\label{sec:functions}

In this sprint we added the ability to define and call functions, with a simple lambda syntax of the form 
\texttt{(\textit{args}) -> \textit{expr}} and function calls of the form \texttt{\textit{funcName / lambda}(\textit{args})}.
Call by value semantics were used, with a new environment created for each function call, consisting of the arguments
bound to the parameter names and the parent environment.

We also added an \textit{assert} statement, allowing for simple tests to be written in the language and support for 
rational numbers.

\section{Sprint 5: Static type checking}\label{sec:static-type-checking}

In this sprint we added static type checking to the language, with a simple type inference system based on 
Hindley-Milner.

The concept of types was introduced, with the types \texttt{Int}, \texttt{Float}, \texttt{Bool}, \texttt{Function} and
\texttt{Never}.

\end{verbatim}

\section{Sprint 6: Bytecode}\label{sec:bytecode}

In this sprint the interpreter was rewritten to use a bytecode interpreter, with a stack based virtual machine as 
well as a simple bytecode compiler, allowing for more efficient evaluation of expressions.
The grammar was not changed in this sprint.

\section{Sprint 7: GUI}\label{sec:gui}

A simple GUI was developed in order to allow easier testing of the language, with a text box for input and output and a 
decompiler output for debugging.
The GUI was written in F\# using Avalonia\citep{avalonia}.
We did not change the grammar in this sprint.

\section{Sprint 8: Plotting}\label{sec:plotting1}

In this sprint we added the ability to plot lists of points, with a simple plotting function that took a list of
\textit{x} coordinates and a list of \textit{y} coordinates and plotted them on a graph using \citet{scottPlot}.
Naturally, we had to add a new type, \texttt{List}, to the language, and as an extension of this, we added the ability to
define lists using the syntax \texttt{[1, 2, 3, 4]}.
Other compound data types such as tuples and records were also added.

\section{Sprint 9: Maths Functions}\label{sec:maths-funcs}

In this sprint we added a number of maths functions to the language, including \texttt{sin}, \texttt{cos}, \texttt{tan},
\texttt{asin}, \texttt{acos} and other, including vector operations, and added the ability to plot functions, both 
built in and user defined.
Support for complex numbers was also added.

\section{Sprint 11: Optimisation}\label{sec:optimisation1}

In this sprint we added a simple optimisation pass to the bytecode compiler, which removed unnecessary stack operations
and combined constant expressions.
The grammar was not changed in this sprint.

\section{Sprint 12: Transpiler}\label{sec:transpiler1}

In this sprint we added the ability to transpile the bytecode to C, which could then be compiled and run as a standalone
executable.
The grammar was not changed in this sprint.
