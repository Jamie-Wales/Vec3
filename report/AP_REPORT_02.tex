\begin{abstract}
Vec3 is a bytecode interpreted maths language complete with a GUI, plotting, full static type inference and various 
maths functions.

The language is designed to be simple to use and understand, with a focus on strict mathematical expressions and 
plotting, but with more powerful constructs such as recursive bindings, first class functions and static type inference.

The language and GUI are written in F\#, using Avalonia\citep{avalonia} for the GUI and ScottPlot\citep{scottPlot} for plotting.
    
The language is compiled to a custom bytecode, which is then interpreted by a virtual machine. 
The language also has the
ability to transpile to C, which can then be compiled and run as a standalone executable, allowing for faster execution of
the code.
    
It is a functional-style language, with a focus on immutability, recursion, expressions and correctness.

Some of the features of the language include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plotting of functions and data
    \item Recursive bindings
    \item First class functions
    \item Static type inference
    \item Strongly typed vector and matrix types
    \item Transpilation to C
    \item Async functions
    \item A GUI
    \item Lots of maths utilities, many of which are implemented in the language itself
\end{itemize}

\section{Aims and objectives}\label{sec:aims-and-objectives}

% todo: moscow
The aim of the project is to create a simple, easy to use maths language with a focus on plotting and mathematical
expressions, but with more powerful constructs such as recursive bindings, first class functions and static type 
inference, and ensuring as many features, both optional and mandatory, are implemented as possible and to a high 
standard.

\chapter{Testing}\label{ch:test}

The language has been tested thoroughly using .Net's built in unit testing framework, NUnit.
Unit tests have been written for the lexer, parser, compiler, type inference, compiler and transpiler.

Additionally, tests have been written in the language itself to test the language's features.
