\begin{abstract}
Vec3 is a bytecode interpreted maths language complete with a GUI, plotting, full static type inference and various 
maths functions.
The language is designed to be simple to use and understand, with a focus on strict mathematical expressions and 
plotting, but with more powerful constructs such as recursive bindings, first class functions and static type inference.
The language and GUI are written in F\#, using Avalonia\citep{avalonia} for the GUI and ScottPlot\citep{scottPlot} for plotting.
    
The language is compiled to a custom bytecode, which is then interpreted by a virtual machine. 
The language also has the
ability to transpile to C, which can then be compiled and run as a standalone executable, allowing for faster execution of
the code.
    
It is a functional-style language, with a focus on immutability, recursion, expressions and correctness.

Some of the features of the language include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Plotting of functions and data
    \item Recursive bindings
    \item First class functions
    \item Static type inference
    \item Strongly typed vector and matrix types
    \item Transpilation to C
    \item Async functions
    \item A GUI
    \item Lots of maths utilities, many of which are implemented in the language itself
\end{itemize}
    
We used an agile approach during development, where we would work on features in small iterations, with regular meetings
and discussions to ensure we were on track.

\section{Aims and objectives}\label{sec:aims-and-objectives}

The aim of the project is to create an easy to use maths language with a focus on plotting and mathematical
expressions, but with more powerful constructs such as recursive bindings, first class functions and static type 
inference, and ensuring as many features, both optional and mandatory, are implemented as possible and to a high 
standard.

\section{The Task}\label{sec:the-task}

The task was to create a maths language with a focus on plotting and mathematical expressions, as well as an 
integrated GUI\@, with possible support for rational and complex numbers, control flow and functions.

\chapter{Discussion, conclusion and future work}\label{ch:discussion-conclusion-and-future-work}

\section{Discussion and Conclusion}\label{sec:discussion}

Everything that we set out to do has been completed to a high standard, and more.
The language is Turing complete, has a GUI, plotting, static type inference, first class functions, compound data types,
recursion, error handling, a transpiler to C, and a standard library.
It also has importing, control flow, async functions, and a large number of built-in functions, as well as support 
for rational and complex numbers.

We feel that the project has been a success, and we are proud of what we have achieved.

\section{Future Work}\label{sec:future-work}

An infinite number of more maths functions could be added to the language, such as more matrix operations, more
trigonometric functions, and more complex number operations, such as plotting of complex numbers.
Additionally, multi-parameter function plotting would be a useful feature, allowing for plotting of custom circles and
ellipses, for example.

However, the language is to a standard wherein lots of these functions can be implemented in the language itself, by 
the user for example, so adding more built-in functions is something that can be done externally and incrementally.

A more IDE like experience, comparable to another maths language like R or MATLAB would be useful, as it would allow 
users a more complete experience, outside of prototyping.
Obviously we have imports, both standard library and user made files, but no way to save progress or set a working 
directory, so this would be a useful feature to add.
