# Presentation Ideas 


# int1.vec3

- Digits [0-9]
- Plus + 
- Minus â€“ (both binary and unary)
  Multiplication *
  Division /
  Remainder %
  Power ^
  Opening bracket (
  Closing bracket )
  Additional tokens:
  Dot . for floating point numbers
  Exponent E for exponential notation of floats (optional )
  Additional requirements:
  It needs to work with integers (integer arithmetic) and floating point numbers.
  Arithmetic expressions need to be entered and executed, in a console window and/or in a GUI (see Task GUI1)
  Processing expressions is left associative
  BODMAS/BIDMAS rules apply
  Parse tree visualisation (optional )
  Division by 0 needs to be detected
  Lexer and parser errors need to be detected and reported.
  
- Runtime testing to ensure that expressions yield a correct result.
  - use asserts here mayb
  
- Rational number arithmetic 
- Complex number arithmetic 
- Works with built-in functions such as cos, sin, tan, exp, log, etc.


# INT 2
Deadline: Week 7
Assignment, functions, closures, casting

x = 10;  	// integer
y = 23.45; // float



# GUI 2 Plotting

First show off builtin functions cos, tan.
Then user functions defined in aplot and then multiple such as root finding;

Initially, a piecewise linear approximation may be used to plot the polynomial but more sophisticated techniques such as spline interpolation can be used to draw smooth curves.
Plots should allow you to zoom in/out and translate the axes so you can explore the plotted curve anywhere in the plane. This means that lines/polynomials extend indefinitely! You may wish to consider this for Task GUI3. instead (advanced plotting).
Trigonometric and logarithmic functions (if implemented as part o arf Task INT1) can be plotted as well and be combined with polynomial functions.

Newton-Raphson 
Bisection
Intergration
To accommodate Task INT4: displaying tangent lines for derivatives and showing areas under the curve for numerical integration.


# Optional 2 plotting expressions on the fly
Done some calculatiosn and you can live do more and interact

# Optional 1 recurisve countdown
if then else 
recursive functions
async 


## Optional 4
Matrix and vector stuff

Dot product, vectors
